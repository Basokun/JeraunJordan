					When the Wischtech threatened to invade the fiefs of Szaalanden, the Emperor dispatched fourteen youths. 
					Of these, the Seven Heroes halted the invasion to herald a time of prosperity while the four Lances of Betrayal were supposedly defeated.
					Two decades later, the Lances of Betrayal have reappeared and formed a bandit militia near the frontier fief Gormbark. 
					A man with a black sword and a scar over his left eye slays an entire troop of that militia. 
					He is identified as the boy, Kóinzell, and becomes as much an object of fear as of hope even as his own past, motivations, 
					and purpose are a mystery to those he meets on his journey.
